As freshmen in college, we quickly discovered that much of the software available to us was either outdated or lacked the functionality we needed. We saw an opportunity to create something better. This led to the birth of Malabar Matrix.

Our initial projects, **KeamRanks** and **VitRanks**, were developed to help fellow students. Seeing the positive impact of these tools, we were motivated to do more.

We then expanded our vision to help small businesses and entrepreneurs. We developed **Trackwise** and **LeadFlow**, two Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) web applications designed for efficiency and centralized management. Being web-based, our users can access them from anywhere, on any device.

Our main goal at Malabar Matrix is to provide small entrepreneurs with access to world-class automation and management software without a large investment. We believe that powerful tools should be accessible to everyone.
